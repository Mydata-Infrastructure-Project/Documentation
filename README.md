# MyData Infrastructure

Documentation about mydata reference implementation

## What do we want to do - and why?

A swedish person, who becomes unemployed will be challenged on multiple levels when it comes to communicating with the labor market and its different stakeholders. It might be through communication with different government agencies, schools and recruitment companies. Many of these interactions are handled manually and/or with paper documents. Our take on MyData is not only to enable a single person to govern their own data but also to simplify the processes of applying for jobs.
JobTech Development together with interested parties are building this project based on our mission to create a digital infrastructure for the Swedish labor market based on open source ideals. Our hope is that by developing this open source project all participants in the project will make contributions of all kinds, such as participating in dialogs and workshops, research,as well as code. All contributions are welcome and necessary regardless of your ability, knowledge, resources or ROI.

Most important is the overall agreement on the project's vision: “to create a reference implementation for MyData regarding accreditation and revocation of consent on the basis of sharing personal data”, something that we hope will become an industry standard.
We strive to work with an open source-methodology of the fundamental idea of joint development and cooperation; the more who work together, contribute and share information the better the solutions. This means that the source code is free for others to use, re-use and develop upon.

JobTech Development is a digital development unit within the Swedish Public Employment Service (SPES) and is leading the process aiming towards open data. Our mission is to build underlying technical infrastructure for private companies and public organizations to develop, innovate and build new digital products and services with the purpose of enhancing the swedish labor market.

One of our three focus areas is individual data. We want to make it possible for people to own, use and transfer their personal data, in an easy and simple way, when operating in the labor market. We observe the MyData Declaration of empowering individuals by improving their right to self-determination regarding their personal data. We act upon its principles, stated by the non-profit international organization MyData Global. This declaration contains three major principles:

1. Human-centric control of personal data
2. Individual as the point of integration
3. Individual empowerment

The focus of this project will be on the Human-centric control of personal data that will empower individuals to give, deny or revoke their consent to share data based on clear understanding of why, how and for how long their data will be used. Read more on [mydata.org](https://mydata.org/).
We have, during our existence (3 years), created different kinds of infrastructural solutions aiming towards a wish to simplify day-to-day business for a jobseeker. These solutions have been developed in collaboration with, or for a small number of users. Our goal is to scale up the number of users. We want to enable more users to get access to more. We want to create a standard for handling consent and revoking it while sharing personal data. This standard should be available to anyone. We think the benefit for society is if we travel FROM CUSTOM TO GENERAL, we want one solution to rule them all.

## Background Mydata

MyData is:

- An infrastructure-level approach for ensuring data interoperability and portability – open infrastructures make it possible for individuals to change service providers without proprietary data lock-ins
- Sector independent – there is currently significant progress being made in individual sectors, such as health and finance, but a cooperative approach could work across all sectors - Consent-based data management and control – it is not necessary for the individual to store all his/her data in centralized repositories in order to control the data flow

MyData is focused on consents because:

- consents are the primary (but not the only) legislative framework that defines information processing from the human-centric perspective
- the same consent management framework can also be used with minor modification for notifications and assignments
- human and machine readable standardized consents unite technical data management systems, legislative frameworks, and the human perspective
